## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with any shorter API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
